# Project: Third Place Navigator (Learning Mode)

## 1. Goal

Build a web app where users find/tag free social spaces using OpenStreetMap (OSM) and OpenLayers.

## 2. Instructions for AI (Teacher Mode)

- **Do not just dump code.** Explain the "Why" behind every library and function.
- **Direct Implementation:** Use vanilla OpenLayers (`ol`). Do not use abstractions like Leaflet.
- **Step-by-Step:** We will build this in "Milestones." Wait for my confirmation before moving to the next one.

## 3. The Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (The framework)
- **Map Engine:** OpenLayers (How we see OSM)
- **Backend:** Supabase (Where we store the "Third Places")
- **Spatial Logic:** PostGIS (How the database understands "Near me")
